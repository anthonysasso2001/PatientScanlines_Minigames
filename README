## Introduction

Separate documentation and implementation folder exist to help partition the project (although two separate repositories will not be used), the documentation folder is for all the diagrams, design, etc and the patient_scanlines folder is the flutter project itself.

## Getting Started

### Software Dependencies

1. Ensure you have the following extensions installed with VS Code, there should be a notification from the .vscode/extensions.json, but you can manually install them from this file as well.
    - Flutter + Dart [link to tutorial on how to install](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code).
    - For the documentation install LaTeX Workshop & LaTeX â€” LanguageTool grammar.
1. Install the necessary Flutter emulators (web, IOS, android, etc).

## Build & Test

To build or test, install flutter and the target emulator then build and run through flutter.

\*Please note all documentation should include the footer
**"Documentation licensed under CC-BY-4.0, code & software examples
licensed under GNU GPLv3."** or similar for clarification, in the case of
visualizations this may be included by a floating box in the corner of
the display.

- Easiest way for TeX documents is to copy this:

```LaTeX
%   footer, to show license information, specifying that data is CC-BY-4.0 BUT non documentation code snippets are GPL3 to unify with main project lisencing.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
% set page style to fancy reset and disable header and footer, then allocate footer type
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead{}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\fancyfoot{}
\fancyfoot[R]{\thepage}
\fancyfoot[C]{\textbf{Documentation licensed under CC-BY-4.0, code \& software examples licensed under GNU GPLv3.}}
```

- For PlantUML this skeleton can be used:

```PlantUML
@startuml PatientScanlines_AppSection_DiagType
title Title of Diagram
!theme vibrant
skinparam linetype polyline

' this is the footer containing license information, should only need to be included one but may have to re-paste on multi-page documents
center footer [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ <img:https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png>]] [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html <img:https://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-88x31.png>]] \n This work is licensed under a [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ CC BY-SA 4.0]],\n code & software examples licensed under [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GNU GPLv3]].
